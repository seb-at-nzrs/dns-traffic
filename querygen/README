Dependencies
- The query generator requires the packages GSL (GNU Scientific Library)
  and JSON library

Make sure you have the following files
- sld-distrib.txt
- edns-buffer-size.dat

The presentation 'DNS-traffic-framework.pdf' contains a walk-trough
about how to use the code.

Quick walk-trough
-----------------

If you don't want to check the presentation, you can be on your way with
the following steps

1. Prepare a sld-distrib.txt file. There is a sld-distrib.example.txt
file that's self-explanatory.
2. make ZONEFILE=zonefile miss-names.txt
This will take the zone file named "zonefile" and will extract a list of
names that do exists. That will be used to prepare a "miss names" file
with labels that will generate negative answers.
3. Prepare your own query type distribution file. The qtype.example.dat
provides a sample of how that file looks like.
4. Prepare your own EDNS buffer size distribution file. The
edns-buffer-size.example.dat provides a sample of how that file looks
like
5. Change the Makefile to set values for HIT_RATIO, EDNS_RATIO,
DO_BIT_RATIO, and RECURS_RATIO
6. make query-list.dat



Feel free to make comments about design or implementation.
