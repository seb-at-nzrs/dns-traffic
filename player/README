This is a modified version of queryperf as included in the BIND sources,
to read the query stream generated by 'querygen' to replay it against an
authoritative server.

The README.old file contains the original README for queryperf.

The original options of queryperf are preserved. There is a new option
(-A) to retry queries using TCP if the response has the TC bit set.


HOW TO COMPILE
--------------

Pre-requisites:
- Modern version of ldns
- jansson (JSON parser in C)

I've tested this procedure in Linux

1) autoconf
2) ./configure
3) make

That will produce a 'queryperf' binary

How to run
-----------

The simplest way to run this is, assuming you already generated your
input file, and that file is named 'query-list.dat'

./queryperf -d query-list.dat -s <SERVER> -1

For instructions how to generate an input file, please read the README
available in the querygen directory
